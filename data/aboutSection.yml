  ### About me

  By day I am a Front-End Developer specializing in JavaScript and accessibility at a midsize company, the number one real estate appraisal platform in France.
  By night I am actively involved in various Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on the Ethereum blockchain. I have recently won several Ethereum hackathons.


  In my current role at Meilleurs Agents my team and I create performant and easy to use interfaces that privilege transparency in the real estate business. We build both B2B and B2C tools.


  Within my team I collaborate with our UX/UI designers, product managers, and other software engineers.
  Aside from coding, I have an eye for design and enjoy participating in design studios and feature prioritization.
  My day to day often involves coding, unit testing, end-to-end testing, data-driven decision making, and contributing to our reusable components library.
  I recently spearheaded initiatives within my company to adopt Typescript and standardize design tokens across all our apps and platforms.
