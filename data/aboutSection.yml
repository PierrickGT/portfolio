  ### About me

  I am a full-time Solidity Engineer at PoolTogether, a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain for no-loss prize games.


  I am most proud of my versatility, jumping from Front-End Developer at my last company to Solidity engineer at PoolTogether. My time working in France as a Front-End Developer honed my coding and design skills.


  Now, I build smart contracts responsible for moving funds deposited by our users into autonomous interest rate protocols like Compound to generate yield that is then awarded to some lucky winners. This way, we help people save money while having a chance to win prizes.


  My passion for Ethereum began by participating in hackathons and collaborating with others in the Ethereum community. I am actively involved in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on the Ethereum blockchain and I have won several Ethereum hackathons.
