  ## My Experience

  I have six years of experience as a Front-End engineer working for startups and large size companies. My previous company has grown exponentially during my time there. In four years, our team of Front-End engineers has grown from four to sixteen.


  My Ethereum experience comes out of participating in hackathons and collaborating with others in the Ethereum community which gave me the opportunity to join PoolTogether full time where I'm currently developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
