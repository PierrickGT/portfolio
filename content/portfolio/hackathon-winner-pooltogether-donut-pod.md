shortDescription: In May 2020, I created a PoolTogether Pod marketed toward the users of the r/EthTrader subreddit. In this subreddit, users are rewarded with DONUT tokens. The goal of my Pod was to allow them to enter the PoolTogether DAI Pool with their DONUT tokens.
challenge: The main challenge was understanding how I could deploy my own Pod and interact with it. As this was my first interaction with Ethereum smart contracts, I had to really understand how the build tools and deployment process worked.
solution: I had to delve into different migration scripts in order to build my own migration script for testing and deploying my Donut Pod. I also built a DApp to connect to Ethereum wallets and to deposit or withdraw funds from the Donut Pod.
